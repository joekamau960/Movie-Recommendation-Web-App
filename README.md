# Movie-Recommendation-Web-App
This project is a simple Movie Discovery Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for movies using The Movie Database (TMDb) API and displays popular movie details dynamically. Users can also upload their own movie poster images through an image upload feature.
